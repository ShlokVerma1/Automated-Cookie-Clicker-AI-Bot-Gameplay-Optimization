## Features

* Automates the clicking process to eliminate 95% of repetitive actions.
* Implements a greedy algorithm to make optimal purchasing decisions in the game.
* Enhances gameplay experience and reduces effort required to progress.

## Installation

To set up the Automated Cookie Clicker AI Bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Automated-Cookie-Clicker-AI-Bot.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Automated-Cookie-Clicker-AI-Bot
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the AI bot with the following command:

```bash
python bot.py
```

### Configuration

Before running the bot, you may need to configure certain parameters in the `config.json` file, such as:

* `click_interval`: The time interval between cookie clicks.
* `purchase_strategy`: The criteria used for purchasing accessories (e.g., greedy, optimal).

## How it Works

The bot uses a greedy algorithm approach to optimize in-game actions by:

1. **Clicking the Cookie**: The CPU automates clicks at the specified interval to collect points continuously.
2. **Evaluating Purchases**: The bot analyzes available accessories based on their cost-effectiveness and prioritizes those that provide the highest return on investment (ROI).
3. **Making Purchases**: Once enough points are accumulated, the bot purchases the optimal accessories, filtering out overpriced options.

### Example of Configuration JSON

```json
{
  "click_interval": 0.1,
  "purchase_strategy": "greedy"
}
